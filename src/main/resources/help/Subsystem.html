      <h1>Subsystem</h1>

      <center><img src="../icons/Subsystem.png" /></center>

    <h2>What is it?</h2>
      <p>A subsystem on a robot is a distinct part of the robot that
  	 performs a certain function. Within the command based robot
	framework, subsystems are encapsulated (represented) by
	classes.</p>
      <p class="lead">Subsystems can contain the following attributes:</p>
      <ol>
	<li>Sensors: Things that sense including buttons, potentiometers,
            encoders and more.</li>
	<li>Actuators: Things that move or act in the physical world,
	    usually motors or pneumatics.</li>
	<li>State: The current status of the subsystem. This can
	    include data recorded from sensors such as the position of
	    the arm or the number of balls stored, information on
	    progress towards a goal, a desired PID setpoint and much
	    more.</li>
	<li>Capabilities: Higher level actions that the subsystem can
            be told to perform by various commands. These are usually
            implemented by functions that update the subsystems state
            in some way.</li>
	<p><b>Note:</b> Simple subsystems may be missing one or more of
           these attributes.</p>
      </ol>

    <h3>What is a default command?</h3>
      <p>Default commands are commands that run on a subsystem when no
         other command is running that requires the subsystem. They
         are the default behavior for the subsystem. This is often as
         simple as a do nothing command so that when a command driving
         the robot stops, the drive train of the robot stops as
         opposed to continuing the last motion it was given. It’s also
         possible to have more complicated default commands such as a
         turret that continuously tracks a target when not doing
         anything else.</p>
      <p>Default commands are created just like any other command. The
	 only minor difference when creating default commands is that
	 you should generally have the isFinished() method return
	 false so that the command is running continuously as opposed
	 to stopping and restarting continuously when no other command
	 is running.</p>


    <h2>Properties</h2>

    <dl>
      <dt>Default Command</dt>
      <dd>The command that runs when no other command is running on
          this subsystem. This command controls the default
          behaviour of this subsystem.</dd>
    </dl>
    
    <h2>Usage</h2>
    
    
    <h3>Organization</h3>
    
    <p>Subsystem are primarily used as an organizational concept. In
       object oriented programming, they also are a very good basis
       for dividing up your robot into seperate classes that
       encapsulate the relevant behaviour.</p>
