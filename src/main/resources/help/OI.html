      <h1>Operator Interface</h1>

      <center><img src="../icons/oi background.png" /></center>

    <h2>What is it?</h2>
      <p>The OI is the operator interface. It connects the buttons and
         joysticks that the operator uses to the commands which they
         should trigger.  The buttons in the OI make it really easy to
         change the functions that each button performs as you test
         the code and add new commands to make the operators job
         easier.</p>
      
    <h2>What types of buttons are there?</h2>
      <p>There are a number of buttons that can be used to trigger
        commands.</p>

      <table>
	<tr><th>Button</th>
	  <th>Class</th></tr>
	<tr><td>JoystickButton</td>
	  <td>A button on a joystick. This is probably the most useful
              type of button.</td></tr>
	<tr><td>DigitalIOButton</td>
	  <td>A button from the digital IO on the cypress module if
               you build a custom physical OI.</td></tr>
	<tr><td>AnalogIOButton</td>
	  <td>A button from the analog IO on the cypress module if you
              build a custom physical OI.</td></tr>
	<tr><td>InternalButton</td>
	  <td>A virtual button that can be triggered in code or put on
              the SmartDashboard.</td></tr>
	<tr><td>NetworkButton</td>
	  <td>A button that is triggered by a value on a network
             table. This is useful for allowing code not on the CRIO
             to trigger commands.</td></tr>
	<tr><td>Custom</td>
	  <td>Buttons Custom buttons can be created by subclassing
              Button and overriding the isPressed method.</td></tr>
