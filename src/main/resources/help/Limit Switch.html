  <h2>What is it?</h2>
  <p>A limit switch is a simple digital input that can be in one of
  two states: pressed or released (aka on and off). The states are
  determined by whether or not the physical switch is being
  pressed</p>
  <h2>Properties</h2>

    <dt>Input Port (Digital)</dt>
    <dd>The DIO Port on the roboRIO or MXP that this limit switch
    is plugged into.</dd>
  </dl>
  <h2>Applications</h2>
  <h3>Limiting movement</h3>
  <p>Limit switches can be used to prevent a manipulator from going
  too far. To do this, the limit switch is placed near the end of
  the desired motion in a way that guarantees that it gets pressed
  at the point you want the manipulator to stop. When the code
  detects the limit switch, it limits the motion of the actuator so
  that it cannot move any farther in that direction.</p>
  <h3>Detecting Objects</h3>
  <p>Limit switches can be placed such that they detect a game
  piece pressing against it. The robot can then react to the game
  piece in some way, such as closing a claw to grab it.</p>
  <h2>Usage</h2>
  <h3>Mounting</h3>
  <p>Use the two holes to secure the sensor in place such that it
  is reliably pressed.</p>
  <h3>Wiring</h3>
  <p>The white wire (signal wire) of a PWM cable connects to one
  pin on the sensor. The black wire (ground wire) of a PWM cable
  connects to the other pin on the sensor.</p>
  <p>The other end of the PWM cable plugs into the DIO on the
  roboRIO or MXP specified by the properties</p>
