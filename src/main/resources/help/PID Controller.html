  <h2>What is it?</h2>
  <p>A PID Controller implements the PID control algorithm. The PID
  control is a useful form of control loop in robotics. It
  simplifies control of a mechanism by creating a system that you
  can tell to go to some setpoint and it takes care of
  automatically moving to that setpoint and maintaining that
  setpoint as long as the PID loop is tuned.</p>
  <p>There are 4 important constants that influence the behavior of
  the PID Controller, by setting any of these to 0, you can ignore
  that coefficient and use a simpler controller if it meets your
  needs. The 4 constants are the proportional, integral,
  derivative, and forcing constants which are explained below.</p>
  <h3>The Proportional Term</h3>
  <p>The proportional control constant of the PID loop is often
  referred to as P or kP. It is the simplest parameter to use and
  in many cases when using PID you really only need the
  proportional constant. The proportional term is very simple, you
  know where you are and where you want to be (i.e. the setpoint),
  so you just take the difference and multiply by kP which acts as
  a scaling factor.</p>
  <h3>The Integral Term</h3>
  <p>The integral control constant of the PID loop is often
  referred to as I or kI. It is useful for overcoming unexpected
  resistance that would stop a simple loop using only the
  proportional constant. The integral term represents the area
  under the curve of the error over time. You know where you are
  and where you want to be (the setpoint), so you just add this up
  over time and multiply by kI which acts as another scaling
  factor.</p>
  <h3>The Derivative Term</h3>
  <p>The derivative control constant of the PID loop is often
  referred to is D or kD. It is useful for preventing oscillation
  that otherwise occurs in a control loop. Derivative is the rate
  of change of the error over time. You know where you are and
  where you want to be (the setpoint), and you know this from the
  past time, so you take the setpoint difference, divide by the
  time difference and as always multiply by a scaling factor. The
  scaling factor in this case is kD.</p>
  <h3>The Forcing Term</h3>
  <p>The forcing control constant of the PID loop is often referred
  to as F or kF. It is used as the feed forward term and is very
  useful for velocity PID. TODO: Fill in</p>

  <h2>Applications</h2>
  <h3>Elevator Control</h3>
  <p>When setup with an elevator and tuned appropriately, the
  elevator can be told to go to predetermined heights by setting
  the setpoint to predetermined values. With this, a press of a
  button can move the elevator to a known height where it can
  pickup and place pieces.</p>
  <h3>Shooter Control</h3>
  <p>With a spinning wheel shooter, a PID controller with a forcing
  term can be used to set the speed of the wheel. When the wheel is
  spinning at the same speed, it will consistently shoot the same
  distance. By determining the setpoint for a distance, you can use
  PID controller to consistently shoot into a basket.</p>
  <h2>Usage</h2>
  <h3>Java</h3>
  <p>Setting the setpoint in java is easy, just call
  <code>my_pid_controller.setSetpoint(2);</code></p>
  <h3>C++</h3>
  <p>Setting the setpoint in C++ is easy, just call
  <code>my_pid_controller.Setsetpoint(2);</code></p>
