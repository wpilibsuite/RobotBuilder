  <h2>What is it?</h2>
  <p>A potentiometer is a variable resistor that is typically used
  on a robot to measure shaft angle or number of turns of a shaft.
  The potentiometer has a resistance that is proportional to the
  angle of the shaft on the device. There are several styles of
  potentiometers available. The potentiometers used on robots
  should be linear taper (not logarithmic as used in audio
  equipment for volume controls).</p>
  <p>Typically a potentiometer shaft can rotate about 270 degrees
  before hitting the hard stop. It is important to make sure that
  the mechanical system the potentiometer is connected to doesn't
  exceed the maximum rotation of the potentiometer or it will
  likely become damaged. For applications requiring more rotations,
  multi-turn potentiometers are available. Using a 10-turn
  potentiometer often simplifies the mechanical design of a system
  such as an elevator where the rotations translate into elevator
  height.</p>
  <h2>Properties</h2>
  <dl>
    <dt>Input Port (Analog)</dt>
    <dd>The analog input on the roboRIO or MXP that this
    potentiometer is plugged into.</dd>
    <dt>Full Range</dt>
    <dd>The range to scale the potentiometer to. For example, to
    scale to 270 degrees, use a full range of 270.</dd>
    <dt>Offset</dt>
    <dd>The offset from zero based on the full range. For a 270
    degree potentiometer scaled from -135 to 135, use an offset of
    -135.</dd>
