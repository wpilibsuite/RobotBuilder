    <h2>What is it?</h2>
    <p>A paragraph or so describing what it is</p>

      <p>A command is a single action performed by the robot. Commands
         usually require at least one subsystem which they act
         with. After being started, a command runs for a period of
         time until either it is finished performing its task or it is
         interrupted. Interruptions can occur either when a command is
         canceled or when another command that requires the same
         command is run.</p>
      
      <h3>What does it mean for a command to require a subsystem?</h3>
      <p>Commands can require a subsystem using
         the requires() method of commands. When a command requires a
         subsystem, it claims exclusive control over that subsystem
         and will interrupt any other command that requires the same
         subsystem. This only works if all your commands properly
         require the subsystems that they use.</p>
