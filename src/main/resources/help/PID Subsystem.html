  <h2>What is it?</h2>

  <p>A subsystem on a robot is a distinct part of the robot that
  performs a certain function. Within the command based robot
  framework, subsystems are encapsulated (represented) by classes.
  PID commands include a built-in PID controller. For an
  explanation of PID, see <a href="PID%20Controller.html">PID
  Controller.</a></p>

  <p class="lead">Subsystems can contain the following
  attributes:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Sensors: Things that sense including buttons,
    potentiometers, encoders and more.</li>

    <li>Actuators: Things that move or act in the physical world,
    usually motors or pneumatics.</li>

    <li>State: The current status of the subsystem. This can
    include data recorded from sensors such as the position of an
    arm, the number of balls stored in a collector, information on
    progress towards a goal, a desired PID setpoint, and much
    more.</li>

    <li>Capabilities: Higher level actions that the subsystem can
    be told to perform by various commands. These are usually
    implemented by functions that update the subsystems state in
    some way.

      <p><b>Note:</b> Simple subsystems may be missing one or more
      of these attributes.</p>
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h3>What is a default command?</h3>

  <p>Default commands are commands that run on a subsystem when no
  other command is running that requires the subsystem. They are
  the default behavior for the subsystem. This is often as simple
  as a do nothing command so that when a command driving the robot
  stops, the drive train of the robot stops as opposed to
  continuing the last motion it was given. It is also possible to
  have more complicated default commands such as a turret that
  continuously tracks a target when not doing anything else.</p>

  <p>Default commands are created just like any other command. The
  only minor difference when creating default commands is that you
  should generally have the isFinished() method return false so
  that the command is running continuously as opposed to stopping
  and restarting continuously when no other command is running.</p>

  <h2>Properties</h2>

  <dl>
    <dt>Default Command</dt>

    <dd>The command that runs when no other command is running on
    this subsystem. This command controls the default behaviour of
    this subsystem.</dd>

    <dt>Send to SmartDashboard</dt>

    <dd>Whether or not to send this PID Controller to the
    SmartDashboard for easy tuning and viewing.</dd>

    <dt>Input</dt>

    <dd>The sensor that tells the PID loop where it is.</dd>

    <dt>Output</dt>

    <dd>The actuator that controls movement of the mechanism.</dd>

    <dt>P</dt>

    <dd>The proportional constant for this PID Controller.</dd>

    <dt>I</dt>

    <dd>The integral constant for this PID Controller.</dd>

    <dt>D</dt>

    <dd>The derivative constant for this PID Controller.</dd>

    <dt>F</dt>

    <dd>The forcing constant for this PID Controller.</dd>

    <dt>Tolerance</dt>

    <dd>How close is close enough for the PID Controller to be
    considered on target, or at the right location.</dd>

    <dt>Continuous</dt>

    <dd>When true, the PID controller is to consider the input to
    be continuous. Rather than using the max and min as
    constraints, it considers them to be the same point and
    automatically calculates the shortest route to the
    setpoint.</dd>
    <dd>*Populate the Minimum and Maximum Input.</dd>
    <dd>Rather then using the max and min input range as constraints, it considers 
      them to be the same point and automatically calculates the shortest route 
      to the setpoint.</dd>

    <dt><strike>Limit Input</strike></dt>

    <dd><strike>Whether or not to limit the range of acceptable input
    values.</strike></dd>

    <dt>Minimum Input</dt>

    <dd>The minimum input value, any value lower than this will be
    considered to have this value.</dd>

    <dt>Maximum Input</dt>

    <dd>The maximum input value, any value higher than this will be
    considered to have this value.</dd>

    <dt>Limit Output</dt>

    <dd>Whether or not to limit the range of acceptable output
    values.</dd>

    <dt>Minimum Output</dt>

    <dd>The minimum output value, any output that would have value
    lower will be output as this value.</dd>

    <dt>Maximum Output</dt>

    <dd>The maximum output value, any output that would have value
    higher will be output as this value.</dd>
  </dl>

  <h3>Organization</h3>

  <p>Subsystem are primarily used as an organizational concept. In
  object oriented programming, they also are a very good basis for
  dividing up your robot into separate classes that encapsulate the
  relevant behaviour.</p>
