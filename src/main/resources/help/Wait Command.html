  <h2>What is it?</h2>

  <p>Creates a new command that is a single action performed by the robot. Commands
  usually require at least one subsystem which they act with. After
  being started, a command runs for a period of time until either
  it is finished performing its task or it is interrupted.
  Interruptions can occur either when a command is canceled or when
  another command that requires the same command is run.</p>

  <p>A <b>WaitCommand</b> runs until it times out</p>

  <h3>What does it mean for a command to require a subsystem?</h3>

  <p>Commands can require a subsystem using the requires() method
  of commands. When a command requires a subsystem, it claims
  exclusive control over that subsystem and will interrupt any
  other command that requires the same subsystem. This only works
  if all your commands properly require the subsystems that they
  use.</p>
