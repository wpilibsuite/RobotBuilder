# This file contains parsers used to get information from code files.
# Currently, this is only used to get the superclasses of Java and C++ classes,
# although it is certainly possible to be used for more than that in the future.


# Filters:
#
# Filters are used to remove text that could trip up a parser. The current
# filters remove C-style comments and whitespace.
#
# Filters should be in the following format:
#    - &[id] !Filter
#      regex: [regex]
# Where:
#   + id is a unique string identifying the filter so it can be used by
#       multiple parsers. This should be in the form idxxx, where xxx is a
#       number not used by any other id
#   + regex is a regular expression matching the text to
# be removed.


# Parsers:
#
# Parsers are responsible for actually grabbing information from the text of a
# file. The two current parsers parse the superclasses of Java and C++ classes.
# If nothing matches the regex, the parser will return an empty string.
#
# Parsers should be in the following format:
#    - !Filter
#      fileType: [extension]
#      regex: [regex]
#      groupNumber: [groupNumber]
#      textFilters:
#        - *id0
#        - *id1
#        - *idN
# Where:
#   + fileType is the extension of the file to be parsed ("java", "h", "py", ect.)
#   + regex is the regular expression matching the desired information
#   + groupNumber is the number of the group in the regex that matches the information
#   + textFilters is a list of pre-processing text filters described above
#
# For example, the filter:
#    - !Filter
#      fileType: java
#      regex: package(\w+)(\S*);
#      groupNumber: 1
#      textFilters:
#        - *id001
#        - *id002
#        - *id003
# will parse the base package of a Java file. This assumes that the file has no
# syntax errors in the package declaration (if there are any, the parser will
# return an empty string).


filters:

  # Matches C-style block comments: /* ... */
  - &id001 !Filter
    regex: /\*[\s\S]*?\*/

  # Matches C-style line comments: // ...
  - &id002 !Filter
    regex: //.*

  # Matches whitespace. This is just used to simplify the parser regexes
  - &id003 !Filter
    regex: \s+

parsers:

  # Java superclass parser that matches:
  #   class Foo extends X {
  # Assumes that the syntax of the file is valid and nobody's trying to
  # screw this up
  - !Parser
    fileType: java
    regex: class\w+extends(\w+)\{
    groupNumber: 1
    textFilters:
      # Remove block comments > line comments > whitespace
      - *id001
      - *id002
      - *id003

  # C++ superclass parser (for header files) that matches:
  #   class Foo : public X {
  # Assumes that the syntax of the file is valid and nobody's trying to
  # screw this up
  - !Parser
    fileType: h
    regex: class\w+:(public)?(\w+)\{
    groupNumber: 2
    textFilters:
      # Remove block comments > line comments > whitespace
      - *id001
      - *id002
      - *id003

  # C++ superclass parser (for implementation files) that matches:
  #   Foo::Foo() : Bar() {
  # Assumes that the syntax of the file is valid, and that the constructor calls
  # the constructor of its superclass
  - !Parser
    fileType: cpp
    regex: (\w+)::\1\(\w*\):(\w+)(.*?)\{
    groupNumber: 2
    textFilters:
      # Remove block comments > line comments > whitespace
      - *id001
      - *id002
      - *id003
